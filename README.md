This repository contains examples of my work from my Assistant Systems Administrator job at Northern Arizon University (NAU) and group projects that have taken place in some of my classes. Below is a short explanation of each folder and its contents.

__Note__: Due to the wishes of my client for my current capstone project, I am unable to post the code here as the client has requested for the code database to remain private. The project is a full Django website hooked up to a MySQL database meant for the storing and viewing of acadmic/scientific articles and their peer reviews. It allows for different account creation types for students and mentors, searching with tags, acrticle and peer review creation, as well as multiple other features currently in development. The project itself is meant to provide a new research environment for graduate students (and possibly regular students in the future) at NAU as well as introducting a space for new researchers to learn the process of peer review.


1. __Professional Work__ (Some of these scripts have been modified to ommit sensitive information about NAU. All have been screened and approved for publication here by NAU ITS)
    - __Bash scripts:__ For Linux and Mac that have been used to resolve technical issues, install applications, and configure software.
    - __Powershell scripts:__ For automation/expiditing tasks through SCCM, GUI creation for user ease of use, and application configuration. There are also a large amount of scripts I have created for application install, but they have been ommitted due to volume and sensitive application information.
    - __Python__: Gathering mac computer data from jamf, automating maintenance tasks, and conversion of data to different storage formats.

2. __Recipe Blog__: Project from a web programming class to create a functional website. Me and my partner for the project decided to make a Recipe Sharing Blog that allowed for filtered searching, full comment threading, collection making, and review sharing.

3. __Scurry Sprint__: Project from 3D game design class to create a basic game. Me and my group decided to make a prototpye of a basic platformer game that involved obstacle doging, coin collection, with a selection of character avatars.

4. __Web Planner__: Project from a software architecure class. Me and my partner decided to make a web planner that allowed for event creation, different event types, type creation, and different user accounts.
